### Roadmap

- Python Crash Course
  - Intro to python syntax
  - Intro to Pandas/NumPy/MatPlotLib
  
- Linear regression [supervised]

  ** Supply them with the data, function headers, and plotting/analysis completed. They'll just write the algo.
  - Simple 
    * Python: Pandas, NumPy
  - Multivariate
    * Linear algebra: Matrices, matrix product, matrix transpose
    * Stats: Variance, (expected value??)
    * Python: Pandas, NumPy
    
- Naive Bayes Classifier [supervised]

  ** Supply them with the data, function headers, and plotting/analysis completed. They'll just write the algo.
  - MNIST B/W
    * Binary hypothesis testing
    * Linear Algebra: Matrices, matrix product
    * Stats: Cost functions, probability/expected value
    * Python: Pandas, NumPy
    
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier [supervised]

- Data Visualizations
  
  ** Walk through a story of how we created visualizations on above 3 supervised learning workshops

- K-Means Clustering [unsupervised]

- Hopfield Network [unsupervised]

Below are taught in 357/361, reconsider.
- Markov Chains

- Map Reduce

### Roadmap

- Python Crash Course
  - Intro to python syntax
  - Intro to Pandas/NumPy/MatPlotLib
  
- Linear regression [supervised]

  ** Supply them with the data, function headers, and plotting/analysis completed. They'll just write the algo.
  - Simple 
    * Python: Pandas, NumPy
  - Multivariate
    * Linear algebra: Matrices, matrix product, matrix transpose
    * Stats: Variance, (expected value??)
    * Python: Pandas, NumPy
    
- Naive Bayes Classifier [supervised]

  ** Supply them with the data, function headers, and plotting/analysis completed. They'll just write the algo.
  - MNIST B/W
    * Binary hypothesis testing
    * Linear Algebra: Matrices, matrix product
    * Stats: Cost functions, probability/expected value
    * Python: Pandas, NumPy
    
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier [supervised]

- Data Visualizations
  
  ** Walk through a story of how we created visualizations on above 3 supervised learning workshops

- K-Means Clustering [unsupervised]
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences
Use kmeans to cluster data of varying length and then attempt to classify it as positive or negative with an SVM. 3 part series.
  1.) Data cleansing with Pandas
  2.) Preliminary visualizations
  3.) Clustering
  4.) Visualize clusters
  5.) SVM classifier
  6.) Review results

- Hopfield Network [memory]

Other ideas
- AWS Sagemaker?
- OpenCV?
- Education datasets (CS 125, 225, 233)?
  - Data cleansing with Pandas
  - Struggling students ML model
  - Visualizations with MPL/Plot.ly

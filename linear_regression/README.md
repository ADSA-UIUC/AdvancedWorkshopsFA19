## Problem Overview

Given a multivariate dataset we want to show simple linear regression, 
and how increasing the number of variables can improve accuracy.

## Required Knowledge 

Linear Algebra: Matrices, matrix product, matrix transpose

Statistics: Expected value, mean, variance, cost functions/RMSE

Python: NumPy to do the above

## Provided

- Function headers
- Cleansed data
- Visualizations
- Main function that calls their function to run the algorithm

## Expected

- Simple Linear Regression (Doesn't require numpy matrix ops)
  - Given: data, cost function
  - Required: loss function, algorithm
  
- Multivariate Linear Regression (Requires NP matrix ops)
  - Given: data, cost function
  - Required: loss function, algorithm
